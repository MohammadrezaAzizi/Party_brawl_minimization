# Party_brawl_minimization
Conceptual modeling of a graph problem based on deep learning.
24 participants with 40 random inital hostile relationships, which can be both bilateral/unilateral.
The goal is to find the proper network setup to find the optimal/partialy optimal adjacency matrix with minimum probability of brawl.
